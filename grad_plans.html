              features many General Education courses taken by me that I believe will be equally as useful to you. This plan also has plenty
              of space for heavy credit minors that require prerequisites.</p>

              may have courses already completed during your first year. One thing I would like to note is that if you don't have any 
              of the benchmark courses completed for this major, your first semester in the major will be a little heavy.</p>

              courses. If not, no worries. This major can be finished within 2.5 years. Though, if you don't have any major-required 
              courses complete, you'll have to take 3-4 of those major-required courses per semester, leaving limited space for Gen Eds 
              and a low credit minor program of 15 credits.</p>

              fall semester (first semester) of their Junior year (third year), with no major-required courses complete. This plan 
              is essentially the same as the third plan but you'll need to complete an additional semester to meet the major 
              requirements. You'll most likely avoid this situation as you have two years of prior credits and completed course work 
              that may satisfy some of the major-required courses. This highlights the need to not just depend on these plans, as everyone's 
              situation is different.</p>
